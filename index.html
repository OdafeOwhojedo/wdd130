        <h2>Delta State</h2>
        <img src="images/deltastate.jpg" alt="Asaba the capital of Delta state">
        <p>Delta state is one of the states in the south-south geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Delta state was created on
            August 27,
            1991, from the former Bendel state. Named after the River Niger's delta region, the state's capital is
            Asaba, located on the Niger River. The state is located in the Niger Delta region and is characterized by
            mangrove swamps and freshwater swamps. Delta state's economy is based on agriculture and the export of
            resources like petroleum, rubber, timber, and palm oil through its ports. The state's population includes
            various ethnic groups with more than 10 different languages and dialects spoken.
            It is bordered on the north by Edo State, the east by Anambra and Rivers states, and the south by Bayelsa
            State while to the west by Ondo State, and the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the
            state's coastline. With its abundance of both human and natural resources, Delta state is one of the most
            important states in
            Nigeria.
