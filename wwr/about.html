            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Real & Ready Rafting Company was established on 30th April 2012 as a subsidiary of Real & Ready groups
                with a staff strength of 5 but has since blossom to a company of more than 30 staff. At Real & Ready
                Rafting, we understand that the difference between success and failure often lies in the determination
                to
                persevere and stay focused, even in the face of challenges. As a company, we are committed to meeting
                our customers'
                needs for additional products at highly competitive prices, driven by our clear ambition to establish
                ourselves as a
                fast-growing and influential brand.</p>
